\title{Evaluate in-sample or out-of-sample logistic model performance}
\usage{
model_evaluate(
  formula,
  data,
  type = c("insample", "cv"),
  folds = 5,
  cutoff = 0.5,
  baseline = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{baseline}{Optional. A character string specifying the reference
level of the response variable. If supplied, the response factor will
be re-leveled to this baseline.}

\item{df}{a data frame containing the predictors and response for the model}

\item{response}{A character string specifying the response variable with 2 variables.}
}
\value{
\itemize{
\item \code{accuracy}: proportion of correct predictions
\item \code{precision}: proportion of predicted positives that are actually positive
\item \code{recall}: proportion of actual positives correctly predicted
\item \code{f1}: harmonic mean of precision and recall
}
For cross-validation evaluation, these metrics are averaged across all folds.

\description{
This function evaluates the performance of a logistic regression model.
Users can specify whether to perform in-sample evaluation on the training data
or out-of-sample evaluation via cross-validation. The function returns key
classification metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, allowing
for a comprehensive assessment of model performance.
}
\details{
This function assesses a logistic regression model's predictive performance.
In-sample evaluation uses the training data to measure how well the model
fits the data it was trained on. Out-of-sample evaluation uses
cross-validation to estimate how well the model generalizes to unseen data.

The function computes standard classification metrics:
\itemize{
\item \strong{Accuracy:} proportion of correct predictions
\item \strong{Precision:} proportion of predicted positives that are actually positive
\item \strong{Recall:} proportion of actual positives correctly predicted
\item \strong{F1 score:} harmonic mean of precision and recall
}

\dontrun{
df <- data.frame(
  y = c("no", "yes", "no", "yes"),
  x = c(1, 2, 3, 4)
)


model_evaluate(formula = y ~ x1 + x2, data = df, type = "baseline", folds = 5, cutoff = .5)
}
