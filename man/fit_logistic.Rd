\title{Fit a Logistic Regression Model with Automatic Factor Handling}
\usage{
fit_logistic(df, formula, baseline = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{a data frame containing the predictors and response for the model}

\item{formula}{A logistic regression formula (e.g., \code{y ~ x1 + x2}).}

\item{baseline}{Optional. A character string specifying the reference
level of the response variable. If supplied, the response factor will
be re-leveled to this baseline.}
}
\value{
A fitted \code{glm} object with \code{family = binomial}.
}
\description{
This function fits a logistic regression model while automatically
converting character variables to factors, setting a desired baseline
level for the response, and converts the response factor
to a 0/1 numeric variable for modeling.
}
\details{
This function makes logistic regression simpler than other logistic functions
by factorizing characters and ensuring the response is binary coded as 0/1
, where 0 corresponds to the
specified \code{baseline} (or the first factor level if no baseline is given).
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
df <- data.frame(
  y = c("no", "yes", "no", "yes"),
  x = c(1, 2, 3, 4)
)

fit_logistic(df, y ~ x, baseline = "no")
}
